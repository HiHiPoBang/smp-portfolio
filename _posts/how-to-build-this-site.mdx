If you would like to build a blog and Bio page coding by yourself from scratch, I will introuduce how to build site with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) which is a strong React-base framework and completed document to start your own site.
And then use a powerful CSS framework, tailwind CSS, to let your blog style beautiful in a easy way.
After completed blog site, build and deploy by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). The developers is same as Next.js, so it has a good integration on it.
I'll show what we'll do in the case, and achieve goal step by step.

First, there are three page we try to build.

## What pages
* **Bio**: self-introduction
* **Blog**: list all the posts
* **Blog/[post]**: the content of post

### Wireframe

#### Home

<br/>

* **Block on the left**
  * On the top of sidebar, there is avatar, name.
  * And on the bottom, there are links of my github, linkedin and medium, also have download button of my resume.
* **Block on the right**
  * There will be Self-introduction, skills and my contact information.
  * And then writing my working experience.

#### Blog and Posts

<br/>

* **Blog: list all the posts in pagination.**
  * There are thumbnail, title, description and read more button on every post block.
  * The pagination buttons which link switch list.
* **Post**
  * There are title, banner, and articlein in the content.
  * Pagination to next or previous post.
  * Comments: a area where you can leave your comments.

## How do I build the site
I use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to build this site, it is a popular React framework, and support to create SSR and SGG apps. To write blog easily, I would like to use markdown. Next.js also provide a a intuitive and simple way using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) to write blog post.
And deploy my site by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

### Others what I use
* [tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/)
* [tailwind-styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-styled-components)
* [ramda](https://ramdajs.com/docs/#)
* [fontawesome 6](https://fontawesome.com/v6.0/icons)
* [utteranc](https://utteranc.es/)

### Use these to improve development
* [eslint](https://eslint.org/)
* [prettier](https://prettier.io/)
* [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
* [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/)

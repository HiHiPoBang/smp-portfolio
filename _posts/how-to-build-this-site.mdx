# How do I build the site
I use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to build this site, it is a popular React framework, and support to create CSR, SSR and SGG apps. To write blog easily, I would like to use markdown. Next.js also provide a a intuitive and simple way using [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/) to write blog post.
And deploy my site by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

* [tailwind-styled-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-styled-components)
* [ramda](https://ramdajs.com/docs/#)
* [fontawesome 6](https://fontawesome.com/v6.0/icons)
* [utteranc](https://utteranc.es/)

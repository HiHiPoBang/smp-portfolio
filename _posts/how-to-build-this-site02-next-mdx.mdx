## What are Next.js & MDX

### Next.js
Next.js is a open-sourced and React-based framework. You can create SSR and SGR app easiily, and it also support ISR with [SWR](https://www.npmjs.com/package/swr) library.
There are completed documents and many [examples](https://nextjs.org/examples) for you to learn Next.js, one of the case is using MDX/MD on Next.js.

### MDX
MDX allow you use JSX in the markdown content. There is a package provide a good integration on it, you can use custom components or override the markdown sytnx with your components.

It's a straightforward way for me writing blog and with less burdensome on maintenance. That's the reason I decide to use MDX and Next.js building my blog. 

## How to start?

Next.js provides a CLI tool enable you to quickliy start building a new Next.js application, you don't need to set up everything by yourself.
I use npm in my case showing.

```
npx create-next-app@latest
```
I would like to use typescript, the CLI tool also provides `--ts` or `--typescript` flag.

```
npx create-next-app@latest --ts
```
After enter this command line, you need to enter `y` and your project name.
